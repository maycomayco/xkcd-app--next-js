# xkcd Next.js

A modern and accelerated clone of the [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com) site developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project focuses on performance and accessibility, allowing you to enjoy your favorite xkcd comics quickly and easily. This frontend application is complemented by a backend, [xkcd-scraper](https://github.com/maycomayco/xkcd-scraper), that provides comic data. In the future, this will be consumed from a yet-to-be-defined database.

## Features

- Display only comics with an ID of 2700 or higher.
- Comic search with Algolia.
- Developed with Next.js for a faster and smoother user experience.
- Focused on accessibility to ensure a satisfactory user experience for all.

## TODO

- [ ] Retrieve new comic files from the backend
- [ ] Improve the search bar
- [ ] Create cards to display comics in the general view and in the single view of a comic
